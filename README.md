# Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning Project: Link Prediction Problem

To fulfill the final project requirement for the class of "Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning" offered at Coursera by University of Colorado Boulder, this repository has the developed codes in Python and the edges data from [Link Prediction UTS on kaggle - Predict the links occurring in next time step, kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/link-prediction-uts/overview) to compute results for the ten (10) similarity metrics that are used as the primary set of features to develop and fit a logistic regression classification to study the link prediction problem.
